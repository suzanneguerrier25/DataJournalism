    <h2> Context:</h2>
    <p>I'm using data from NYC's Urban Park Rangers (who are called by NYC residents to attend to animals, for example, a stray cat, a racoon, or in this case, birds). This dataset contains the status of the animals (healthy, unhealthy, injured), species (ex. hawk), and location (ex. Prospect Park), as well as how the animal was attended to. I'm using this data to analyze where birds have been injured in NYC, to raise awareness about the Park Ranger Service. By seeing the data for injured birds, NYC residents (or visitors) will hopefully be more motivated to make a call themselves. Personally, I had never heard of this service beforehand, despite being an NYC resident.</p>

    <p> Provided by the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), Accessed through NYC OpenData</p>
    
    <h2> Data Cleansing Pipeline:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Downloaded the data as a csv file and import to google sheets </li>
        <li> Used google sheets to edit the data, deleting columns that weren't necessary to my narrative (ex. if the police was called) and removing rows that contained non-birds / non-raptors (eg. hawk) </li>
        <li> Downloaded the edited csv file to VS Code, and used a <a href="https://github.com/suzanneguerrier25/DataJournalism/blob/main/data/format_data.py">format_data.py</a> file in conjunction with the json library to make a json file with the organized data</li>
        <li>    Organized the data as a dictionary with the time and date as the key- separating the indivdual calls, and a list with the other attributes as the values</li>
        <li>    I also removed any extra space as well as edited the Birds, Domestic to be Domestic Birds to facilitate conversion. I also edited any addresses with quotations for the same purpose</li>
    </ol>
    <h2> Prototyping and Designing:</h2>
    <div class="protodescards">
    <div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">

          <h5 class="card-title">Main Page</h5>
          <p class="card-text">My initial idea for the main page was to have a map of NYC, with data for bird calls in each borough, and a summary on hovering a borough. I wanted to keep this summary simple by expanding to simply number of injured birds per borough, which conveys my message by showing how the data is spread across boroughs.

          <h5 class="card-title">Borough Specific</h5>
          <p class="card-text"> 
            For my borough specific pages, I planned to have a map of each borough, highlighting the parks, since that is where most birds were called in. I also added multiple possible charts summarizing the data. Firstly, number of injured birds by location, which I felt conveyed my message because when looking at the data per location, inhabitants of each location can know to look out for birds. Furthermore, I felt a bar chart would most effectively communicate the information.
             <br>
             <br>
             Alternatively I considered a breakdown by species of bird, which I felt would convey my message by pinpointing which type of bird to look out for, as some might get more injured than others. I wanted to keep the graph simple with a bar chart, which would visually separate each species. I would also highlight the most injury-prone species with a darker color.
            <br>
            <br>
              Finally, I considered a line graph on what times of year calls were being made, as that would pinpoint a time where residents should be the most vigilant. I chose a line graph as it would most simply show trends in certain times of the year.
            <br>
            <br>
              I also included a potential color scheme, limiting my palette to a few colors to highlight key information.

    <h3> Feedback</h3>
    <p>Peer feedback I received can be broken down into 2 main points
        <br>
        - Simplicity: The excess of graphs could distract the reader from the message, especially if unorganized
        <br>
        - Message: Be more clear with how the graphs help the reader to draw conclusions
        <br>
     To address these, I plan to clearly state on the specific pages how each graph relates to my message, and also potentially crowdsourcing data for if my peers knew about the park ranger call-in beforehand. Furthermore, I will separate the species graph (and potentially others) onto an additional information page, if the visitor would like to know more. On this page I will also post relevant resources.
