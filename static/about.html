    <h1> Bird Calls: Injured Birds in NYC 2022</h1>
    <h2> Context:</h2>
    <p>I used data from NYC's Urban Park Rangers which contains all calls made about animals, for example, finding an injured stray cat, and edited it to focus on calls about birds- injured, unhealthy, or others. I'm using this data to determine where these calls are happening, by borough, and by a more precise location in the city, as well as what types of birds are being injured.</p>
   
    <h2> Data Sources:</h2>

    <h2> Data Cleansing Pipeline:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Downloaded the data as a csv file and import to google sheets </li>
        <li> Used google sheets to edit the data, deleting columns that weren't necessary to my narrative (ex. if the police was called) and removing rows that contained non-birds / non-raptors (eg. hawk) </li>
        <li> Downloaded the edited csv file to VS Code, and used a <a href="https://github.com/suzanneguerrier25/DataJournalism/blob/main/data/format_data.py">format_data.py</a> file in conjunction with the json library to make a json file with the organized data</li>
        <li>    Organized the data as a dictionary with the time and date as the key- separating the indivdual calls, and a list with the other attributes as the values</li>
        <li>    I also removed any extra space as well as edited the Birds, Domestic to be Domestic Birds to facilitate conversion. I also edited any addresses with quotations for the same purpose</li>
